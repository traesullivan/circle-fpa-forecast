# Financial Forecasting Model  
A Python-based financial forecasting project for Circle, demonstrating predictive analytics and data visualization.

# Overview  
This project utilizes Python,Excel and Tableau to generate financial forecasts for Circle. Due to the limited availability of public financial data, a data-driven approach was applied to extract, process, and predict key financial metrics.  

The forecast models revenue, expenses, and churn trends up to 2028 using time-series forecasting techniques, providing insights into potential financial performance.

Please note that all files and code are included for your perusal as well. 


# Methodology

# 1. Data Extraction & Generation  
- AI-Assisted Data Retrieval: Extracted publicly available financial insights from press releases, industry benchmarks, and investor reports.  
- Synthetic Data Generation: Where direct financials were missing, Python was used to simulate values based on market trends and historical patterns.  

# 2. Forecasting Model
- Applied Time-Series Analysis:  
  - ARIMA & Exponential Smoothing for trend forecasting.  
  - Growth Rate Projection for revenue and expense estimation.  
- Churn Rate Estimation: Modeled subscriber churn using historical behavior patterns.  

# 3. Data Visualization  
- Tableau Dashboards: Built interactive visualizations to compare actual vs. projected financials.  
- KPI Tracking: Included profitability metrics, revenue trends, and subscriber movement over time.
